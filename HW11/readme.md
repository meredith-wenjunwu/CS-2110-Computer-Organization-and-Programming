# Malloc

My implementation of Malloc (dynamic memory allocation) for CS 2110 - Fall 2016 at Georgia Tech.

## To Run

Clone the repository. Then run `make test` to run any of the tests written in test.c. Feel free to try it out  just as you would use `malloc()` and `free()` in C. For grading, navigate to `grader/` and run `make grade`. Check graded.txt for more detail.
